				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				
				<p>Currently in many manufacturing industries including black metallurgy and steel industry, 
					There is a tendency towards a wider use of contactless temperature measuring means.
						This is due to the advantages of pyrometers over contact measuring means.</p>
				
				<p> For example, measuring the temperature of steel in the range of it’s melting temperature (1300&deg;С&ndash;1800&deg;С), will help to avoid the idle time of steel fusion, so there is no need for additional heating to move to the next production step. The steel melting process is accompanied not only by high temperatures,
					but it is also a complex of chemical and physical processes of interaction of molten steel with added impurities, as well as flux, slag, furnace gases,
					formed during steel heating and furnace lining. By maintaining the desired temperature, the steel will not be able to cool and &ldquo; liquid &rdquo;,
					fusin does not have time to become &ldquo;viscous&rdquo; mass that needed to be heated again to the desired aggregate state in order to be able to be casted.
					This directly depends on compliance with the standards of finished products, competitiveness in the world market and financial result of the company.</p>
		
				<p>Additional heating of the steel requires additional energy, and the amount of energy required is large enough, 
					which can lead to the costs of the enterprise for additional heating of the metal composition. Additional heating is also necessary if there is a need to add any impurities or remove them,  as well as alloying steel &ndash; giving steel some special properties (strength, heat resistance, corrosion resistance, etc.). 
					 The alloying operation is the reduction of elements, such as chromium, nickel, etc., into a steel melt, the order of their entering is determined by their physical and chemical properties and &ldquo; affinity for oxygen &rdquo;. 
					 All these processes need to be monitored and and it is needed to be known that where it is unacceptable to exceed the temperature, 
					 or vice versa &ndash; when the melt of steel must be maintained below the &ldquo;mean&rdquo; melting temperature (about 1300&deg;С&ndash;1500&deg;С) to properly enter the various elements into the molten composition.
					 In order to create certainty in the temperature mode and to obtain stable technological results, it is necessary to withstand a certain degree of metal overheating in each case. 
					 Measuring the temperature of a molten steel has the main meaning of determining the degree of it’s overheating.
					 Therefore, the temperature measurement error should not be greater than the degree of overheating of the metal. 
					 The flow of reactions in liquid metal, its fluid flow and further &ndash; the quality of production products depends not as much on the absolute value of temperature, at which the process is carried out,  but as much of the degree of overheating of the metal with respect to its temperature of the beginning of hardening.</p>
	
				<p>Most fusions melt in a certain temperature range. The first portion of liquid melt appears when some temperature is reached, but. 
					If the temperature is no longer increased, the amount of liquid will remain the same. The liquid and solid phase will be in equilibrium. 
					When the temperature increases, the amount of liquid increases, and when it reaches a certain value, all solid metal changes into liquid.
					This interval is determined by state diagrams for each metal system and is enclosed between so&dash;called solidus and liquidus lines.
					The exception is the so&dash;called eutectic alloys, which do not have such an interval and melt at the same temperature, at once.
					For steels of different degree of ease the interval is (1300&deg;С&ndash;1800&deg;С). 
					Of course, different dopants affect the melting and crystallization range in their own way.</p>
	
				<p>Development of mathematical model of non&dash;stationary heat transfer through multilayer lining was carried out in the work of N.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;Mikhailovsky and S.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;Beitsun (scientific and technical journal &laquo;System technologies&raquo;, Ukraine) [<a href="#ref1">1</a>]

				<h2>1. Relevance</h2>
				
				<p>At the moment, high&dash;temperature infrared pyrometers are the most common in the field of heavy industry, as due to the variety of existing temperature meters, 
					there are difficulties and problems in production to measure and carry out control at specified temperature intervals, 
					such tasks are mainly solved by contactless infrared pyrometric devices. No pyrometers are professional diagnostic tools for measuring temperature at virtually any distance.</p>
	
				<p> The nomenclature of domestic commercially produced pyrometers for measurement of melt temperature is very limited, 
					and they do not provide solution of many technological tasks of steel production, 
					so development and introduction of new devices for control of technological processes during steel production is a pressing task.</p>
				
				<p>One of the most complex problems in pyrometry of partially transparent materials is the elimination of errors resulting from simultaneous exposure of the instrument to a large number of physically different interferences and factors. 
					The application of traditional techniques of exclusion of their influence leads to considerable complexity of the device design, its maintenance, reduces operational properties and reliability.</p>
	
				<p>Therefore, it became necessary to study and develop new methods of contactless temperature measurement, as well as to improve, modernize already ready&dash;made technological solutions in order to improve the accuracy of measurements. 
					The most promising direction of solving the above problem is the application of structural&dash;algorithm methods and the creation of systems operating in automatic calibration mode. 
					The contactless temperature measuring device shall take into account a number of factors affecting the final result of the measurement process.</p>

				<h2>3. Overview of existing high temperature measurement methods</h2>
				
				<p> Measurement of high temperatures in the field of ferrous metallurgy and steel industry is a necessary means of controlling the quality of products of enterprises,
					the efficiency of measuring devices will depend on the technological and production process itself, which will directly affect the production.
					The right choice of measuring tools will help to avoid downtime and reduce the financial costs of various processes, such as additional heating of the molten metal.</p>
				
				<a name=p31></a>
				<h3>3.1 Thermocouple</h3>
				
				<p> Thermocouples [<a href="#ref2">2</a>-<a href="#ref3">3</a>] are widely used in the industry as temperature sensors and measuring devices. A thermocouple is two wires of different metals, сonnected at one end, called measuring or "hot" junction.
					The other end, where the wires are not soldered, is connected to conductors going to the measuring circuit and is called cold solder.
					There are many different types of thermocouples with different materials and configurations [<a href="#ref4">4</a >]. 
					These conductors are most often made of copper. The main advantages of thermocouples include: </p>
					<ol style="list-style-type: disc;">
							<li>high precision of measurements;
							<li>Sufficiently wide temperature range;
							<li>high reliability;
							<li>simplicity in service;
							<li>relative low cost.
						</ol>
	
						<p> Thermocouples work on the so&dash;called <q>Zeebeck effect</q>, which was discovered by the German scientist T.&nbsp;Zeebeck. 
							The Zeebeck effect is as follows: if you connect two conductors (thermoelectrodes) made of heterogeneous metals or alloys so that they form a closed electric circuit, and then maintain the places of contacts (adhesions and) at different temperatures, then in the circuits will flow. 
							A circuit that consists of only two different conductors (thermoelectrodes) is called a thermoelement or thermocouple. </p>
	
							<p>The electromating force causing current in the circuit is called Seebeck’s thermo&dash;EMF and in the first approximation depends only on the thermoelectrode material and the junction temperature difference.
									The thermoelectrode, through which the current goes from hot weld to cold, agreed to consider positive, from cold to hot &ndash; negative.
									When a thermocouple such as TCA (chromel&dash;alumel thermocouple) is designated, the positive electrode material is indicated in the first place in the name, and the negative electrode material is indicated in the second place.
									Thus, knowing the temperature of one junction (usually kept constant, e.g. 0&deg;С) and measuring the current or voltage in the circuit,
									It is possible to uniquely determine the unknown temperature of another weld.</p>
	
				<p>To protect metal&dash;immersed thermocouples, it is difficult to select a sufficiently resistant refractory material. Molybdenum&dash;tungsten thermocouple is used in graphite shell. 
					In tungsten&dash;graphite and carborund&dash;graphite thermocouples graphite thermoelectrode is arranged in the form of external tube protecting another thermoelectrode placed in it. </p>
	
					<p>Thus, a relatively stable thermal receiver is provided, which can be in the liquid metal medium for more or less time and receive continuous changes in its temperature. 
						Platinum thermocouple is successfully used in quartz glass shell, but only in short&dash;term immersion. 
						In this case, only a virtually instantaneous and periodic measurement is possible. This is how the low&dash;inertial thermocouple method (or fast immersion method) is implemented, 
						which is currently most important compared to other existing liquid metal temperature measurement methods.</p>

				<h3>3.2 Pyrometer</h3>
				
				<p>Pyrometer (infrared thermometer) is a device for contactless temperature measurement. Depending on a scope, there are two types of infrared (IR) thermometers: stationary and figurative (portable).
					Pyrometers belong to the group of non&dash;destructive test devices, which allows to measure temperatures without direct contact with the measured surface, as in the case of <q>conventional</q>, contact thermometers.
					Their use guarantees safety in the diagnosis of defects and monitoring of various processes.</p>
				
				<p>Pyrometers, like thermocouples, have a number of advantages and disadvantages [<a href="#ref5">5</a>]. Among the advantages it is important to note the following:</p>
	
				<ol style="list-style-type: disc;">
						<li>high speed;
						<li>Possibility to measure temperature of moving objects or objects under high voltage potential;
						<li>Absence of distortion of the temperature field of the object of control;
						<li>Possibility of long&dash;term measurement of high temperatures at which the use of contact measuring devices is either impossible or their operation time is very short;
						<li>Possibility to operate under conditions of increased radiation and ambient temperature (up to 250&deg;С) at separation of receiving head and pyrometer electronics with the help of fiber optic cable.
					</ol>
	
					<p>For one enterprise it is enough to purchase several such devices, they are convenient, mobile, have low error with correct adjustment and they can measure many production processes at the same time. Conventional pyrometers operate in temperature ranges (50&deg;С&ndash;1200&deg;С) and their error within such measurement limits is quite low due to preset parameters and the ability to adjust before use.
						More expensive types of pyrometers have the possibility to adjust parameters more accurately and flexibly to perform their tasks, and they are designed for higher temperatures &ndash; from (500&deg;С&ndash;1000&deg;С) to (1500&deg;С&ndash;2000&deg;С) and more, in them very low wavelength, compared to cheaper analogues, which is ideal for measuring various melts.</p>
	
						<p>The operation [<a href = "# ref6">6</a>] of the electronic contactless temperature measurement device is based on the principle of infrared radiation generated by the measurement object, the principle is shown in Figure 1.
							Any infrared pyrometer has such a characteristic as optical resolution (D:S).</p>
	
						<div class=img>
								<img style="width: auto; max-width: 100%;" src="images/pyro_work_en.jpg" alt="Principle of operation of non&dash;contact infrared pyrometer">
								<p class=imgcaption>Figure 1 &ndash; Principle of operation of non&dash;contact infrared pyrometer</p>
							</div>
						<p>
							It is defined as the ratio of the distance between the pyrometer and the measured surface (D) to the diameter (S) of the measured area on that surface. 
							In this case, the pyrometer is similar to a conventional household flashlight. If you turn on the flashlight and point the beam at the wall, you can see the light spot. 
							If you put the flashlight against the wall, the diameter of the spot will decrease and vice versa, increase when removed. 
							As well as the pyrometer &ndash; the further away it is from the surface, the larger the diameter of the area it will receive heat waves. 
							At the same time, if not only the object of measurement is located in this area, but also the extraneous object, the pyrometer averages the result and the measured temperature will not be correct. 
							Optical prism is used to increase distance (D) and decrease diameter (S) in pyrometer. The larger the prism magnification, the greater the distance from which small objects can be measured. 
							It is worth noting that a contaminated prism can make an error in the measurements. 
							It is necessary to clean it periodically. To approximate spot diameter, many pyrometers are equipped with laser target pointers.</p>
				
				<p>Design of contactless devices for temperature measurement is detailed in the works of A.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Bukarev, V.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Lesnoy, A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Kislitsyna (NTUU &laquo; National Aerospace University named after N.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Zhukovsky <q>HAI</q>&raquo;, Ukraine)  [<a href="#ref7">7</a >], and B.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;Skorik and A.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;Geiko (&laquo;Dnepropetrovsk National University&raquo;) developed recommendations for choosing a pyrometer [<a href ="# ref8">8</a >]. 
					Peculiarities of working with optical contactless thermometers are described in the work of Y.&nbsp;N.&nbsp; Bilichenko (scientific and technical journal &laquo; Electrical and computer systems &raquo;, Ukraine) [<a href ="#ref9">9</a>].</p>

					<h2>5. Factors that affecting on the accuracy of measurements, ways to avoid</h2>
	
					<p>In the process of measuring temperature with an infrared contactless pyrometer, a number of factors arise [<a href="#ref12">12</a>], which introduce their error and influence the accuracy and final result of the temperature measurement.
						Figure 3 shows the process of measuring the temperature of molten steel in the ladle, taking into account the interference occurring in the path of infrared radiation between the measurement object and the contactless measuring device.

							Figure 3 &ndash; Process of measurement of melt temperature of steel in ladle by infrared contactless stationary pyrometer
					</div>
	
					<p>It should be noticed that the accuracy and stability of temperature measurement depends on the correct choice of pyrometer. There is no universal pyrometer that will solve all the tasks set for it to measure temperature. Both pure and oxidized metal surfaces can be measured with sufficient precision using infrared pyrometers of various types. The type of pyrometer used depends on several parameters.
							It is most common and efficient to use a pyrometer that operates at the shortest possible wavelength, but there are also cases where it is necessary to stop your choice for a pyrometer of spectral ratio.
							The main factor is the stability of the radiation characteristics of the measured surface of the heated material during the working process, as well as the degree of oxidation of its surface. The presence and nature of the atmosphere entering the measurement zone is also an important factor. It is necessary to take into account that pyrometers of spectral ratio have never found wider distribution corresponding to their theoretical base. The error of pyrometers [<a href="#ref11">11</a>] depends on a complex of factors: </p>
	
					<ol style="list-style-type: disc;">
						<li>Surface of observed area of the object must be in the place of direct view;
						<li>Dust, fog, steam and other objects between the heat sensor and the heat source attenuate the signal, as do traces of contamination on the optics; 
						<li>Structure and state of the surface of the investigated body influence the intensity of infrared flow and readings of the temperature meter, for example, 
							scale on the metal melt introduces a large error, as its color&dash;physical properties differ greatly from those of the metal melt surface;
						<li>Wavelength of infrared spectrum at which measurement must be selected correctly;
						<li>Light glare in the lens of the photodetector as a result of reflection from the surface of the object of measurement of daylight or emission of tungsten lamps;
						<li>temperature of the object of measurement.
					</ol>
	
					<p>There are some recommendations have been developed for the use of pyrometers for each individual[<a href="#ref11">11</a>] case atm.
						There are a number of very important features, protective measures in the design, manufacture of physical models and use of contactless pyrometers, among them: </p>
	
						<ol style="list-style-type: disc;">
								<li>apply coating of printed circuit boards and electronic components with moisture&dash;resistant varnish to reduce influence of environmental humidity;
								<li>in order to reduce the influence of electromagnetic fields created by the operating electric power system, provision is made for shielding from electromagnetic leads, calculation of screen parameters shall be performed at the stage of design and process design; 
								<li>in order to reduce the impact of network interference caused by the operating power plant, a protective network filter is provided in the power supply structure of the test equipment.;
								<li>reduction of factors polluting the production space by installation of extracts for removal of gases and vapours;
								<li>timely cleaning of rooms and equipment from dust and dirt affecting factor in air &ndash; between measuring device and measurement object;
								<li>maintenance of optimum temperature in working and production rooms to reduce damp and, as a result, excessive moisture;
								<li>development of structural parts for the device, which make it possible to reduce the effect of loss of radiation flux density and its dispersion,
									as well as reduce the influence of light highlights reflected from other surfaces during measurements;
							</ol>
	
				<p>My task is to develop and improve methods, model and develop mathematical models, as well as take into account the influence of external factors,
					Which will make it possible to make adjustments to the operation of one specific type of device, qualitatively improving its accuracy. Here reference should be made to the absorption of radiation in the field of sight of the pyrometer[<a href="#ref11">11</a>].</p>
	
					<p>It is always necessary to make great efforts to reduce the effect on radiation absorption measurements due to obstacles in the field of sight of the pyrometer.
						This can be achieved also due to optimal arrangement of pyrometer, presence of constant blowing with purified air (inert gas) of field of sight.
						In case the measures taken do not help:</p>
	
						<ol>
								<li>If there is water vapour or hydrogen dioxide in the atmosphere &ndash; selection of the optimal working wavelength of the pyrometer for this atmosphere.
									It should be taken into account that when using two spectral pyrometers, one of the working lengths of the walls is completely absorbed by water vapor (hydrogen dioxide),
									Then the obtained temperature measurement results will be greater than when measured with a monochromatic pyrometer of similar wavelength.
									The error of the measured temperature will always be proportional to the effective wavelength of the two pyrometers.
								<li>In the presence of combustion products between the pyrometer and the objects to be measured (carbon dioxide at 2.7 um and 4.3 um), it is necessary to use pyrometers with a longer wavelength.
									In the presence of gas or smoke, the spectral ratio pyrometer measures the so&dash;called "color temperature" of the radiation source, with the resulting effect of partially darkening the field of vision of the pyrometer with small particles (the size of which is commensurate with the wavelengths used in the pyrometer) similar to how you would view the sun through the fog.
									The temperature of the sun in the 6000К would appear to be a dark cherry color that would correspond to the temperature of the 1000К. Similarly, a measurement of the flow of liquid steel through the veil of fog and smoke can be imagined.
									None of the pyrometers can cope with this temperature measurement task, but a monochromatic pyrometer will always produce a better result than a spectral one.
								<li>The presence of dust, particles and vapor droplets in the vision area of a pyrometer larger than the wavelength used gives the opposite result.
									Their effect on the spectral ratio pyrometer is not large and the use of this pyrometer is more preferred.
									The absorption of radiation by water droplets (visible saturated vapor) is also largely independent of the wavelength used.
								<li>The presence of water does not affect the permeability of short wavelength radiation, but water absorption of radiation increases rapidly with wavelength.
									If it is necessary to measure the temperature through the water layer, this can only be done if the measurement object is sufficiently hot.
									For measurement by a monochromatic pyrometer which has a wavelength of not more than 1 um.

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				
				<p>The object of measurement was analyzed &ndash; melt of steel in cast iron ladle, as well as peculiarities of steel melting, methods of its casting, heating.
					The main methods and devices by means of which temperature control of molten steel is carried out are considered.
					The need to control the temperature of molten steel is justified.</p>
	
					<p> Infrared pyrometers are fairly accurate, reliable, and have a longer life;
						Their temperature measurement range is considerably wider and includes a high temperature region where the contact means are unsuitable;
						The temperature sensitive element and other parts of the device do not directly contact the high temperature and often aggressive medium.
						High speed of pyrometers, ability to measure the temperature of hard&dash;to&dash;reach and movable objects, small&dash;sized objects or films,
						Without disturbing the temperature field of this object, it is possible to solve important technological tasks, for which contact means are not always applicable.
						Almost universal use of pyrometers for the purpose of measuring high temperatures and controlling the temperature of molten metal leads to the need to take care about the influencing factors,
						on which the final result of measurements depends.</p>
